            is launching its first publication micro-grant! After 2 years we are
            eager to give back to our community!<br />
            Throughout the past two years we published 3 student press
            publication + typejournal (a branch of 100m/a studio). And we have
            made a small revenue selling these publication; so now we want to
            give back to our community and open these opportunities to other
            OCAD students. <br /><br />
            The grant money will be allocated to groups of student initiating
            publication projects of their own. This is a great chance for them
            to reflect on their practice and create alongside other peers.
            <br />

            Our call starts in Sep (asap) and projects will hit the ground
            running after the info session in OCT. During this period the
            accepted applicants will receive support from us and can checkin in
            our monthly sessions. In March we’ll be hosting a launch party for
            our grant cohort, giving them a chance to talk about their
            experience while sharing their craft with friends and peers.<br />Finally
            to wrap up, we’ll be hosting a 100m market featuring our grant
            cohort + other vendors and students from OCAD. A chance for everyone
            to generate money from their labour but also engage with other
            students, faculty, members of public etc.

            <br /><br />

            you’ll help us support and create more publications, more
            collaboration, more care and more generosity.
